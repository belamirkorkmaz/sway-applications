# Getting Started

## Requirements

To begin, install dependencies.

- [Node.js v20.11.0 or latest stable](https://nodejs.org/en/). We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install.
- [PNPM v8.15.7 or latest stable](https://pnpm.io/installation/)
- [Rust v1.76.0 or latest `stable`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Forc v0.61.2 with latest toolchain](https://install.fuel.network/latest)

## Running Project Locally

### 📚 1. Getting the Repository

1. Visit the [Sway Application](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-applications) repo and fork the project.
2. Then clone your forked copy to your local machine and get to work.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-applications
cd sway-applications
```

### 📦 2. Install Dependencies

```sh
pnpm install
```

### 📒 3. Run Local Node

This command will start a local Fuel node

```sh
cd token-SRC20
pnpm fuels:node
```

### 🛠️ 4. Build and Deploy contracts

Now that you have the local node running you can build and deploy the contracts.  This command will build the contracts, generate their ts types for the frontend, deploy the contracts, and set the owner of the NFT contract.

```sh
pnpm fuels:run
```


###  💻 5. Run Web App

Now that you have your contract and its types you can start your frontend.

Start the frontend with the following command:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

After running that command, you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the explorer working.

### 🧪 7. Run Contract tests

```bash
cd token_contract_src20
forc test 
```

# Overview

A fungible token or more commonly referred as ERC 20 in the Ethereum ecosystem  is a unique asset that can be minted with a supply of your choice, burned and transferred. On the Fuel Network, all tokens are [Native Assets](https://docs.fuel.network/docs/sway/blockchain-development/native_assets). 


# Standards Implementations

The project implements and follows the [SRC-20; Native Asset](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md), [SRC-3; Mint and Burn](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-3.md), and [SRC-7; Metadata](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-7.md) standards. It also uses the [Native Asset Library](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway-libs/book/asset/index.html) to implement the basic functionality behind the standards.  

## SRC-20
SRC-20 is a standard for fungible tokens built in Sway.

The [SRC-20](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md) standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for Native Assets using the Sway Language. This standard provides basic functionality as well as on-chain metadata for other applications to use.
The [SRC-20](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-20.md) ABI defined below has also been implemented.

```sway
abi SRC20 {
    #[storage(read)]
    fn total_assets() -> u64;
    #[storage(read)]
    fn total_supply(asset: AssetId) -> Option<u64>;
    #[storage(read)]
    fn name(asset: AssetId) -> Option<String>;
    #[storage(read)]
    fn symbol(asset: AssetId) -> Option<String>;
    #[storage(read)]
    fn decimals(asset: AssetId) -> Option<u8>;
}
```

## SRC-3

The [SRC-3](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway-standards/blob/master/SRCs/src-3.md) standard defines the ABI for minting and burning. This has been properly implemented.

```sway
abi SRC3 {
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn mint(recipient: Identity, sub_id: SubId, amount: u64);
    #[storage(read, write)]
    fn burn(sub_id: SubId, amount: u64);
}
```
